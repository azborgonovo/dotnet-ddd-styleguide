# .NET Domain-driven Design Style Guide

## Purpose
*.NET Domain-driven Design style guide for teams by [@azborgonovo](//www.linkedin.com/in/azborgonovo/)*

If you are looking for an opinionated style guide for syntax, conventions, and structuring .NET Domain-driven Design (DDD) applications, then step right in. These styles are based on my development experience with [Domain-driven Design](//dddcommunity.org/), presentations and working in teams.

The purpose of this style guide is to provide guidance on building .NET Domain-driven Design applications by showing the conventions I use and, more importantly, why I choose them.

## Special Thanks
Thanks to Jhon Papa which inspired me with his awesome work on the Angular Style Guide

## Single Responsibility

### Rule of 1
###### [Style [Y001](#style-y001)]

  - Define 1 component per file, recommended to be less than 400 lines of code.

  *Why?*: One component per file promotes easier unit testing and mocking.

  *Why?*: One component per file makes it far easier to read, maintain, and avoid collisions with teams in source control.

  *Why?*: One component per file avoids hidden bugs that often arise when combining components in a file where they may share variables, create unwanted closures, or unwanted coupling with dependencies.

  The following example defines the `app` module and its dependencies, defines a controller, and defines a factory all in the same file.

  ```javascript
  /* avoid */
  angular
      .module('app', ['ngRoute'])
      .controller('SomeController', SomeController)
      .factory('someFactory', someFactory);

  function SomeController() { }

  function someFactory() { }
  ```

  The same components are now separated into their own files.

  ```javascript
  /* recommended */

  // app.module.js
  angular
      .module('app', ['ngRoute']);
  ```

  ```javascript
  /* recommended */

  // some.controller.js
  angular
      .module('app')
      .controller('SomeController', SomeController);

  function SomeController() { }
  ```

  ```javascript
  /* recommended */

  // some.factory.js
  angular
      .module('app')
      .factory('someFactory', someFactory);

  function someFactory() { }
  ```

### Small Functions
###### [Style [Y002](#style-y002)]

  - Define small functions, no more than 75 LOC (less is better).

  *Why?*: Small functions are easier to test, especially when they do one thing and serve one purpose.

  *Why?*: Small functions promote reuse.

  *Why?*: Small functions are easier to read.

  *Why?*: Small functions are easier to maintain.

  *Why?*: Small functions help avoid hidden bugs that come with large functions that share variables with external scope, create unwanted closures, or unwanted coupling with dependencies.
