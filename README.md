# .NET Domain-driven Design Style Guide

## Purpose
*.NET Domain-driven Design style guide for teams by [@azborgonovo](//www.linkedin.com/in/azborgonovo/)*

If you are looking for an opinionated style guide for syntax, conventions, and structuring .NET Domain-driven Design (DDD) applications, then step right in. These styles are based on my development experience with [Domain-driven Design](//dddcommunity.org/), presentations and working in teams.

The purpose of this style guide is to provide guidance on building .NET Domain-driven Design applications by showing the conventions I use and, more importantly, why I choose them.
